## Introduction

The goal of _Elm Land_ is to solve common problems folks run into when creating web apps. 

Before the actual NPM tool is ready, it's important to make a plan for what we need to build, and create the core documentation. Leading with documentation is a great trick for validating if a design is easy-to-follow and worth pursuing.

## Running the docs site locally
