## 🏄‍♂️ Becoming Mainstream!

Back in 2015, Evan Czaplicki gave a talk called [Let's Be Mainstream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYk8CKH7OhE). It introduced [Elm](https://elm-lang.org), a programming language designed to make web development easier for _everyone_.

Today, frameworks like React or Vue.js come with incredible tooling that makes them great choices for creating web applications. The goal of _Elm Land_ is to create a similar experience for folks building apps in Elm. 

Whether you are new to frontend programming, experienced with JS, or an Elm expert– these tools are designed for you! Let's make reliable web development accessible for everyone!
