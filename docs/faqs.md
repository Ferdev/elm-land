# Frequently asked questions

These are a few questions that have come up in the [Elm Land Community Discord](https://join.elm.land). 

If you have a question that isn't answered here, be sure to let us know in the `#beginners` or `#general` channel. We'd be happy to provide help there, or make the answer easier to discover from this website.

## "What's next for Elm Land?"

We have [a public roadmap on GitHub](https://github.com/elm-land/elm-land/wiki/Roadmap) that gets updated after each release. If you're using Elm Land, and have an idea for how to improve the framework, please let us know! You can post your suggestion in the `#suggest-a-feature` channel of the [official Elm Land Discord](https://join.elm.land).

Many of the more recent features have come from users reporting on their experiences using Elm Land in practice.

## "Can I do server-side rendering?"

Elm Land focuses on creating and deploying __single-page applications__. This helps keep hosting costs low or, in most cases, completely free!

It also eliminates complexity during development. Understanding why some parts of your app render on the server, and others in the browser, isn't always easy.

Because we only support client-side rendering, Elm Land is a great choice for "web applications". For example, if your app is behind a sign-in page, SEO doesn't matter as much. 

If you are creating "websites", like this one, we recommend using a tool that better fits the problem at hand.
