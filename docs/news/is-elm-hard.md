# ðŸ§  Is Elm hard to learn?

Written by _Ryan_ on _June 19th, 2023_


## Going from React to Elm

In January 2023, I watched a React developer learn Elm for the first time, live on Twitch. That developer is [Sai](https://www.twitch.tv/saiforceone), a fullstack web engineer living in Kingston, Jamaica. After Sai saw the Elm Land homepage, he dedicated an entire stream to trying out Elm for the first time.

Sai began with the ["Getting Started" guide](/guide/). __Within seconds__, he had a brand new Elm application running in his web browser. Getting to "Hello, world!" was easy, and made Sai excited to learn more.

As I continued watching, I started to notice a few obstacles along the way. Elm Land was designed to make Elm accessible to everyone, especially first-time learners like Sai. For that reason, I began to take notes on which areas needed the most improvement.

### Editor plugin trouble

Before Sai could begin following the step-by-step tutorials, he needed to get his editor set up. Like many web developers, Sai used [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as his editor of choice. 

After installing the recommend Elm plugin, Sai ran into some unexpected issues. The plugin was reporting outdated errors that led him down a troubleshooting rabbit hole. Ultimately, the solution was to restart VS Code to make those errors go away.

After that, Sai proceeded through the Elm Land guide. Being familiar with other plugins, he tried to use some features like "Rename all", but it didn't rename files as expected. He used some Git tricks to get things back in a working state, and carried along through his journey.

### Cryptic error messages

Elm is reknown for having [really helpful error messages](https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/735197548034412546?s=20). Unfortunately, in Elm Land v0.18.0, those would show in __generated code__ outside of Sai's control. 

As a first-time user of the framework, it wasn't clear how to resolve the issues.

Sai did some troubleshooting and realized that Elm Land had some expectations that weren't being made clear. As designer of the framework, I realized I had a responsibility to make the quality of Elm Land on par with the quality of the Elm language itself.


### The inspiring part

Despite those hurdles, Sai is a resourceful engineer. He had overcome similar problems with other tools in the past. By the end of his stream, he made an __impressive__ amount of progress through the guides! 

As someone who has seen many folks learn Elm over the years, I noticed something unique with Sai's experience: He didn't notice the weird syntax. The technical details around "type safety" or "functional programming" didn't come up once.

Sai was too busy adding pages, layouts, and other features to his app. As an application framework, the Elm Land guides could focus on answering Sai's biggest question: "_How do I build a real app?_" 

By the end of Sai's journey, I had my list of areas to improve Elm Land. I was motivated by how much Sai had accomplished in that session. Over the next few months, I began to build the next iteration.

## Introducing Elm Land v0.19.0

Today, I'm excited to announce Elm Land v0.19.0. Unlike many previous updates, this one goes beyond the `elm-land` CLI command. Sai's experience learning wasn't just about running a dev server, or scaffolding out a new page. If I want Elm Land to be awesome, the full journey needed to be taken into account.

### The Elm Land VS Code plugin

When it comes to text editors in 2023, Visual Studio Code has been among [the highest rated](https://www.g2.com/categories/text-editor?tab=highest_rated) and [easiest to use](https://www.g2.com/categories/text-editor?tab=easiest_to_use). For that reason, many frontend developers trust it to build apps with React, Vue, Svelte, and other popular JS frameworks.

To help ensure a reliable experience, this release comes with an official [Elm Land VS Code plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=elm-land.elm-land):

![A screenshot of the Elm Land VS code plugin](../images/vscode-plugin.png)

Elm Land is all about having a reliable experience, and this plugin has been written from the ground-up in TypeScript, to provide you with feedback directly from the Elm compiler itself. At [Vendr](https://www.vendr.com/), we've been using it with our 600k+ lines of code application, and haven't experienced any performance issues.

You can learn more about features, performance benchmarks, and meet the wonderful folks that helped make this possible by visiting the official repo at [@elm-land/vscode](https://github.com/elm-land/vscode).

To report issues, contribute, or make feature suggestions, start a thread in the `#vscode` channel of our [Elm Land Community Discord](https://join.elm.land).

### Elm Land error messages

When a developer sees an Elm Land error message, it should always provide clear, actionable context. Previously, Elm Land allowed some of those errors to be reported in generated Elm code in the `.elm-land` folder. 

To prevent that from happening, Elm Land now provides it's own set of problems, designed to look and feel just like Elm's core error messages:

![Screenshot of the Elm Land error message for a missing "page" export](../images/elm-land-error-messages.png)

For example, the error above is letting someone know that removing the exposed `page` function will make this page unable to render. Users can learn more about theses errors in more detail on [the new "Problems" page](/problems).

After upgrading to Elm Land v0.19.0, you should never see an error message for a generated file again.

### Better guides, more examples

Elm Land is more than just a CLI tool or an editor plugin. The true value of the framework is in providing clear guides for beginners and helpful documentation for experienced Elm Land engineers.

The initial pass of the guide was targeted towards folks coming from JS. If you already knew Elm, it was hard to understand what Elm Land added to the core experience. After a huge overhaul to the documentation, both newcomers and Elm folks alike will have an easier time finding what they need:

__Before__ (Elm Land `v.0.18.0`) | __After__ (Elm Land `v.0.19.0`)
:-- | :--
![The old guide sidebar featuring 9 pages](../images/docs-before.jpg) | ![The new guide sidebar featuring 25+ pages](../images/docs-after.jpg)

In addition to the original guide, we've added some new sections:

- __[Concepts](/concepts/)__ - An overview of how Elm Land works, the core concepts, and why you might customize certain modules.

- __[Reference](/reference/)__- API documentation for Elm Land modules like `Route` and `Page` that you'll use day-to-day in your applications.

- __[FAQs](/faqs)__ - Common questions about the Elm Land project itself, including links to the official roadmap.

This update also comes with an [Examples](/examples/)__ gallery. This includes all the [official examples](https://github.com/elm-land/elm-land/tree/main/examples) from the Elm Land repo.

If you would like to feature your project in the Examples gallery, please let us know in the `#cool-projects` channel in the [Elm Land Community Discord](https://join.elm.land). We're more than happy to showcase the wonderful stuff you make!


### New framework features

This update also comes with some core upgrades to the CLI, driven by feedback from folks in the Community Discord:

1. __URL Hooks__ â€“ Allows pages and layouts to respond to changes in the URL. This is helpful when using query parameters to filter data or perform other effects in response to a URL change.

2. __Layouts upgraded__ â€“ Layouts now support the ability to include a `msg` parameter. This is helpful for embedding actions in a layout's header or sidebar, that fire events to the page using the layout.

For a deeper dive on how to use these in practice, be sure to visit [the official guide](/guide/).

If you were previously using _elm-spa_, Elm Land's predecessor, now is a great time to upgrade! In terms of framework features, Elm Land has exceeded what was possible in _elm-spa_. Additionally, the Elm Land error messages are here to give you more meaningful feedback as you upgrade your project.

## What's next for Elm Land?


### Reliable web apps for everyone!

Since Elm Land's ["Hello, world!" post](./hello-world.md), the goal has been to share the joy of reliable web app development with as many folks as possible. By providing __solid developer tooling__, __beginner-friendly learning resources__, and __clear conventions__ for scaling apps, developers are empowered to build amazing things.

The future of Elm Land will continue to involve more real world example apps and improved guides. In the near term, future updates will help folks answer questions like: 

- "How do I work with a GraphQL API?"
- "How can I upgrade an existing project?"
- "How can I prevent navigation when a user is filling out a form?"

### How you can help

### We'll get there together!

The best part of Elm Land is our community. The [Elm Land Community Discord](https://join.elm.land) is a friendly place where folks use channels like `#cool-projects` to share what they're building. It brightens my day to see the great work that folks share in that channel, and how everyone supports one another. 

I hope you enjoy the latest Elm Land release, and I can't wait to see the cool stuff you build. 

__Let's be mainstream!__ ðŸŒˆ
